PS C:\Users\Lenovo\OneDrive\Desktop\Git Practice\Muni_Repo\Muni_Repo>

the above is my previous working folder, what ever changes i made those are belongs to only that folder
which makes changes only in that repository.

now i created his foldeer in local machine IDE lets see how to push this to GitHub repo

1st -> change working space in terminal 
    cd .. --> this moves working space to one step back, means not in current folder, 
        it moves to the prevoius folder then it works with that same or we can change the folder what ever we nee

2nd -> change directory to current folder
    cd Muni_Demo_Repo --> this will change the working directory

3rd -> convert this ordinary folder into a git folder
    this folder and files in it has been created manually it's not been cloned from git
    .git -> to consider a folder as a git folder it must has to have .git file or folder in it
    otherwise it won't be considered as git folder or repository

    to make sure about it 1st run git status, it won't show any file details inside the folder

git init --> this commandd initializes the normal folder into a git folder convert's it as local repo
        after running this can see a .git hidden folder in the same folder

4th -> git add folder name or git add . -> now i have 2 files in my folder to add both i don't want to 
    write git add fileName1 then git add fileName2.

    git add . --> this will move all available file to the staging are from folder

5th -> git commit -m "commit message" --> this move to local repo

6th -> git push origin main --> here we can't use this directly cause this repository is created  locally
        so in GitHub there no repo created yet to commit with  origin

        with out creating a repo is GitHub we can't get origin link to push the consider

        if we try it will throw error: failed to push some refs to 'origin'


before doing all the below things create the new repository in Git

git remote add origin repository_link  --> this command is used to add the new repository as origin in local machin

git branch   --> this will show branch name master instead of main (it's not a branch)

git push origin master  --> instead of git push origin main we can use master to push 

or

git branch -M main  --> renaming the name master as main and then use the old command

git push origin main --> this works only after renaming



After creating new repository below suggestions will been shown for quick setup

    This is tto create new repository on Command line
        echo "# GitHub_Practice" >> README.md
        git init
        git add README.md
        git commit -m "first commit"
        git branch -M main
        git remote add origin https://github.com/Muniyappan-Singaravel/GitHub_Practice.git
        git push -u origin main


    This is to push an existing repository from command line
        git remote add origin https://github.com/Muniyappan-Singaravel/GitHub_Practice.git
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main
